Analysis steps:

(1) Run the EyeLink_Subject_Analysis_v5.m script. This will preprocess the EyeLink data and segment the EyeLink data into epochs
(2) Run the EyeLink_Group_Analysis_v2.m script. Creates pupil, blink, and microsaccade timecourses in Figure 3, Figure 5, and Supplementary Figure 3.
(3) Run Machine_Learning_Subject_Level_Layered.m script. Creates Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 5. 
(4) Run EyeLink_Plot_Subject_Eye_Timecourses.m script. Creates pupil, blink, and microsaccade timecourses in Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 6.

Helper Functions
EyeLink preprocessing (e.g., pupil blink removal): stublink.m and Stublinks60.m
